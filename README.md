# Custom `App` builder for Next.js

### What is a Custom `App`?

Next.js uses the App component to initialize pages. You can override it and control the page initialization. Which allows you to do amazing things like:
- Persisting layout between page changes
- Keeping state when navigating pages
- Custom error handling using componentDidCatch
- Inject additional data into pages
- Add global CSS

For more details, see [offical documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).
